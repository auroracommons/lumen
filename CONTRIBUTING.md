# Contributing to LUMEN

Contributions are welcome, and the door is kept visibly open:
there is always at least one good first issue available. The house
rule is the evidence rule: a contribution ships with the run that
proves it (the eval output, the smoke test), not just the code.
The second house rule is this repo's founding one: nothing here is
described as working unless it runs.

## Setup

```bash
node packages/catechism-rag/demo/guarded_qa.mjs "Why did God make you?"
node packages/catechism-rag/demo/guarded_qa.mjs --eval
node packages/liturgy/src/__smoke__.ts
```

## Good first issues (sized in hours)

- **Add refusal eval cases (about an hour).** Extend
  `packages/catechism-rag/demo/eval_cases.json` with blocked,
  allowed, or borderline texts and rerun the eval. Paraphrases of
  the guarded forms are the most valuable additions, because the
  request screen is a pattern list and the suite should show where
  it stops working.
- **Grow the demo corpus (1 to 2 hours).** Add one lesson from the
  same public domain source via `demo/build_corpus.py`, checking
  each added answer against the refuser first and recording any
  exclusion the way Q.241 and Q.242 are recorded.
- **Write the liturgy test suite the smoke script asks for
  (2 hours).** `packages/liturgy/src/__smoke__.ts` says in its own
  header that it replaces a real test suite until one exists.
  Port its checks to a runner and add the edge case it does not
  cover: a transferred feast.
- **Fix a scaffold label (under an hour).** If any file in this
  repo describes scaffold code in the present tense, that is a
  bug of the kind this project exists to catch. File it or fix it.

## Ground rules

- The refuser is the contract. Changes to its patterns land with
  eval cases that justify them, in the same change, and the eval
  is rerun and its artifact updated.
- No present-tense claims for scaffold code, in code comments,
  docs, or PR descriptions. Label plans as plans.
- Citations or it does not ship: any answering surface added here
  carries its sources the way the demo does.

## Pull requests

Keep them small and single purpose. State the evidence in the PR
description: what you ran and what it showed. Contributors are
named in release notes.
